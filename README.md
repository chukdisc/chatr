# FaceSpace
## An online chatroom Rails app

### Summary

FaceSpace is one of the coolest team projects I worked on at Metis. Along with Katherine and Sinclair, we chose to build a chatroom app. We decided to experiment with some new html 5 video elements to integrate the use of the webcam. Basically, when a user sends a chat text, their webcam snaps a photo of their current facial expression and posts it with their message. Additionally, we used Pusher to handle live updating of the chats without reloading the page.
